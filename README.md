# Task-Scheduler

This is a program developed for CS3560 - Object Oriented Programming and Design

The goal of the program was to create a Task Scheduler that was capable of allowing the user to create different types of tasks, like a transient task or a recurring task or an anti-task. 

Transient Task - A Task that occurs once and only once
Recurring Task - A Task that occurs repeatedly at a regular schedule
Anti-Task - A Taks that cancels out a recurring task at defined time
